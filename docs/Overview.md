*Website Title:* Jungle Books (a CurlyCupboard Creation)

*Project Description:* Jungle Books fosters a love of reading by creating a welcoming environment to encourage users to discover new books, and log their reads and make reading a more enjoyable experience.

*Project Owner/Sponsor:* Mrs. Dafoe. She is an English teacher that emphasizes a reading zone for students. Since this is a reading/book-themed website, Mrs. Dafoe can tell us what features she would like in a website, to help students engage more in reading. Hopefully, when we have our website deployed, she can put a QR code in her classroom for students to scan.

*Slogan Ideas:*

- "Curliest Vines and the Coolest books in the Canopy"
- "Let's Rumple in the Jungle"
- "Where the Wild Things Are"
- "let's CURL up with a cool book, under a cozy canopy"
- Mascot = Curly the chameleon (part of our design theme is using C words'
- Vibe = jungle, adventure, cozy rainforest, watercolor, animals, creature theme.
