### PII Concerns: We talked to Mrs. Dafoe and she said that one concern she would have with a forum, is that students can upload innappropriate content. She wants us to make sure students can't upload things like that. One way we have to combat that is that the only upload/post option we would have available is on local storage, so it wouldn't be accessible by other studnets.

Feedback/Requirement:
<br>

- give positive reinforcement to a reader <br>
- positive reinforcement can be in the form of earning points or something similar <br>
- positive reinforcement makes them want to go back  <br>
- positive enforcement for us is social  <br>
- reading group, get connected  <br>
- some sort of channel for people to share their ideas and opinions regarding books  <br>
- drop down menu of really easy and accessible titles  <br>
- give books a "bio" so readers can preview them and find what they might be interested in <br>
- link to forum where you can do discussion  <br>
- Website is catered to 2 groups: <br>
    - People who want to get into reading  <br>
    - People who already read but want to explore deeper <br>
    - Do this by creating a form of a directory when you first create the website and allows you to reach different home pages  <br>
- two different forums, for two different groups  <br>
- two different main pages for the two types of people  <br>
- forums need to be monitored to avoid misuse and inappropriate behavior   <br>
- Make the website more personalized; based off of previous reads what would someone like to read in the future?  <br>
- Note: Make sure the website isn't too general, make it more personalized and in depth so that it's unique.  <br>
- different genre match feature  <br>
    - ex: non-fiction and fiction, how do they relate? <br>

Feedback/Requirement:

- Showed her our visuals  <br>
- Agreed on a Creative Commons Liscence --> if other csp students want to make reading websites from this that's okay --> just to have to attribute our work  <br>
- Suggested that pages are like a choose your own adventure (once you choose a side, either reading or non reading, you go to pages that are not displayed on nav bar) <br>
- More info on curriculum books --> said students can lose interest  <br>
- Make it more interactive with the student curriculum <br>
